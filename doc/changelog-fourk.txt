NetHack Fourk Changelog Overview:
=================================

This document describes the changes that have been made in NetHack
Fourk specifically, which are different from the upstream NetHack 4
codebase.  For changes made in NetHack 4, see instead changelog.txt

Thematically, the major changes fall into the following overall
categories:

 * Balance adjustments.  Various formulae have been revised, to
   improve the overall balance and difficulty curve of the game.
   Things like death-drop probability, engraving success rate,
   alignment record, etc. have had the shape of their curve adjusted,
   and some game features have been buffed or gently nerfed so that
   they fit better into the overall scheme of the game's balance.
   
 * Monster/class reorganization.  Some classes with very few monsters
   have been combined and thus freed up, so that in a subsequent
   version some heavily overloaded monster classes can be split,
   without running out of letters.  I tried to be conservative about
   this, and for now I tried to avoid having any monster look exactly
   the same as another monster used to look, when it can be avoided.
   
 * Differentiation (aka improved variety).  Some monsters, items, or
   special levels that were practically identical have been tweaked
   slightly so that they are no longer quite so closely the same.
   Some special levels may get new versions, as well.

 * Consolidation.  Some meaningless things that didn't really add to
   the game have been removed or combined with others.  Monsters,
   objects, skills, etc.


Chronological Changelog (most recent at top):
=============================================
=============================================


Changes in 4.3.0.2:
-------------------

 * It is possible to specify COLNO and ROWNO at compile time (put
   something like -DROWNO=30 in the CFLAGS environment variable
   when running aimake).  Note that changing these values breaks
   save compatibility and is known to be buggy at this time.

 * Added the Geoduck tileset, by Robert M. Cook.  This tileset is
   based on the idea of prominently incorporating the traditional
   ASCII symbols for each monster (and in many cases item) into
   the graphical tile, but with enough added detail that you can
   more easily see and remember what it is.  It may be of interest
   to beginners who wish to eventually play in ASCII or Unicode
   mode but are intimidated by it at first.

 * Excalibur is now easier to get for Knights, harder for others.

 * Gehennom is now mostly composed of a new type of cavern level,
   generated by the ais cavern algorithm.  Mazes can still be found
   in Gehennom on special levels, for now.

 * The number of maze levels between Medusa's Island and the Castle
   has been increased slightly.

 * The #enhance screen how shows you both your current skill level
   and your skill cap (maximum level your character can achieve).

 * Sylphs can no longer be Valkyries; but they can be Rangers and,
   for the time being, Wizards.  (Sylph Wizard is highly tentative
   and may get removed if it proves too unbalanced.)

 * Wands of digging now dig multiple tiles in Gehennom (and other
   maze levels), the same as everywhere else.

 * Any weapon you get in starting inventory will have a skill cap
   no less than basic.  (Your starting skill was already being
   raised to basic.  This prevents you from being above your max.)

 * Dwarves can now always get to at least skilled in pick-axe,
   and can get to expert if a human of the same role would be
   able to get to skilled.

 * Gnomes can always get to skilled in crossbow and aklys and can
   go two skill ranks higher than a human of the same role, up to
   a maximum of expert (crossbow) or master (club).

 * Orcs can get at least skilled in scimitar and two ranks higher
   than a human of the same role up to a maximum of master.

 * Sylphs can always get at least basic skill in healing spells,
   regardless of their role, and can get to skilled if a human of
   the same role could get to basic.

 * The scroll of amnesia has been removed from the game.  It is
   replaced with the scroll of water, which generally creates pools
   around the player.  (Some dungeon features can be destroyed by
   this, replaced with a pool; others, such as stairs, cannot.)  If
   cursed, one of the pools will be placed at the player's location.
   If blessed, there is a small chance to get a fountain instead.
   Although the scroll of amnesia was one of the most useless items
   and thus was never given as starting inventory, I consider the
   scroll of water to be potentially more useful than the scroll of
   punishment, which previously could be; so scroll of water can be
   given as starting inventory, and scroll of punishment now cannot.
   Note that the scroll of water will not work on the Planes.

 * Intelligence-draining attacks no longer also cause amnesia.

 * Multi-firing is more difficult when using silver projectiles.
   (They're still advantageous against silver-fearing targets, of
   course, because the increased silver damage is worth more than
   a higher multi-fire rate.)

 * Added a new type of stone, silver nuggets.  These count as sling
   ammo and do silver damage.  The best place to find silver nuggets
   is on the caveman quest, but they can also be generated randomly.

 * The Rogue quest now contains a guaranteed spellbook of sleep.

 * Further alignment record adjustments have been made.  The penalties
   for attacking peacefuls and for killing generated-peaceful and
   always-peaceful monsters have been adjusted again.  Non-lawfuls now
   get no penalty for killing mundane peaceful monsters; killing
   always-peaceful ones still has a penalty for all alignments, but it
   is smaller than before.  Lawful characters can regain alignment
   points by killing hostile chaotic demons.  The alignment benefits
   of sacrifice have been restored to their vanilla level of
   effectiveness.  Using a poisoned weapon while lawful will no longer
   take your record below 0.

 * Valkyrie starting inventory has been rebalanced again.  They
   always get the wand of cold now, and their starting enchants
   have been rebalanced again.

 * Sokoban tries to give you a prize you don't already have.  For
   example, if the level you get would normally have a bag of holding
   but you already have one and don't yet have reflection, an amulet
   of reflection may be substituted in place of the bag.  There are
   limits to how creative the game gets, however; you can still end up
   with something redundant if you already have more than one of the
   possible prizes.  Note that unidentified rings you are carrying
   can have an impact on which ring you get as your prize, even if
   they are not equipped.  Also, the prize is determined at the moment
   the prize level is generated, so if you enter the level but don't
   finish it and come back later, the prize is not changed again.

 * Rogues now get the "backstab" bonus if the target monster is
   fleeing (strike from behind); frozen, trapped, or unable to move
   (catch at a disadvantage); or sleeping, blind, confused, or stunned
   (strike unaware).

 * Grimtooth is permanently poisoned and also grants poison resistance;
   additionally it warns of elves and does extra damage to them, even
   if they are poison resistant.

 * The call/name menu implicitly allows alternate menu accelerators:
   a for C, b for y, c for n.  (This is to accommodate players whose
   muscle-memory was trained on NAO.)

 * Barbarians attacking with an axe or battle-axe at Skilled or better
   get free bonus attacks against adjacent enemies.  In each of the
   diagrams below, you (@) attack a monster at target position (T),
   and any monsters at the free-attack positions (F) will be attacked
   as well.  Also, Barbarians can now get Master skill in axe.

   Skilled ("wide arc"):
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....
   ...F.  .F...  .FTF.  .....  .TF..  ..FT.  .....  .....
   ..@T.  .T@..  ..@..  ..@..  .F@..  ..@F.  ..@F.  .F@..
   ...F.  .F...  .....  .FTF.  .....  .....  ..FT.  .TF..
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....

   Master ("tremendous arc"):
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....
   ..FF.  .FF..  .FTF.  .....  .TFF.  .FFT.  ...F.  .F...
   ..@T.  .T@..  .F@F.  .F@F.  .F@..  ..@F.  ..@F.  .F@..
   ..FF.  .FF..  .....  .FTF.  .F...  ...F.  .FFT.  .TFF.
   .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....  .....

 * Lower-level nymphs now blink away when they steal something.
   Blinking normally works on a straight-line clear-path basis (sort
   of like line of sight, but they can blink into the dark or when
   blind) with a distance based on the nymph's level.  (However, if
   there are no available spaces to blink to, the nymph may be placed
   farther away.)  For wood and water nymphs, this replaces their
   ability to teleport at random times or warp to an entirely random
   location when stealing.  One side-effect of this change is that you
   can no longer get intrinsic teleportitis by eating them, which
   seems fair.  Mountain nymphs, which are higher level, blink when
   they steal but can also teleport at other times; and you CAN get
   teleportitis by eating them.  I reduced the mountain nymphs'
   frequency number (from 2 to 1), but they can now generate in small
   groups (the only n to do so).  Also, a fourth, even higher level
   type of nymph has been added, the island nymph.  These warp away
   just like vanilla nymphs; of course you can get teleportitis by
   eating them.  They normally generate infrequently but can be
   summoned by the Summon Nasties monster spell.

 * A new playable race has been added, Sylph.  Sylphs are a type of
   elemental fairy creature.  As such, they have fairy senses and so
   tend to see monsters as they are, rather than as they appear --
   they see invisible and are not fooled by shape changers, and they
   get infravision at level 5 and intrinsic detect monsters at level
   16.  They also get stealth at level 5 and displacement at 7.
   Perhaps most interestingly, Sylphs regenerate health and power by
   drawing from their environment (which can heal status effects as
   well as restore HP and Pw), but in order to do so they must be able
   to feel the natural world around them -- the air on their skin, the
   ground under their toes, etc.  Thus, they cannot draw power and
   health if wearing armor made of anything but cloth or wood (except
   for their own quest artifact), or if they are levitating, or while
   polymorphed.  (Also, there is very little healing to be drawn from
   the environment in Gehennom.)  Sylphs are always female.  They can
   be neutral or chaotic and can currently be Priests, Rogues,
   Healers, Rangers, or Wizards.

 * Attribute maxima now depend on role as well as race.
   The role contributions are as follows (where 1 places
   the character's overall maximum where it was in vanilla):
   Rol | Str Int Wis Dex Con Cha
   ----+-------------------------
   Arc |  1   1   1   1   1   1
   Bar |  2   0   0   2   2   0
   Cav |  3   0   0   1   1   1
   Hea |  0   1   2   1   1   1
   Kni |  2   2   0   0   0   2
   Mon |  2   1   2   1   0   0
   Pri |  1   2   0   1   2   0
   Rog |  1   1   0   2   1   1
   Ran |  1   1   1   2   0   1
   Sam |  2   0   1   2   1   0
   Tou |  0   1   2   1   0   2
   Val |  1   1   1   2   1   0
   Wiz |  0   2   2   1   0   1
   These values are experimental; some of them will probably
   need to be adjusted, but this is a starting point.

 * Ice devils now have an attack that immobilizes the target
   in ice.  (Fiery monsters, such as fire elementals, are not
   immobilized but sustain damage.)

 * Piranha generate in larger groups and have more attacks.

 * Mazes in Gehennom can now have wall and/or corridor widths
   other than 1 tile.  Occasionally, they can have "walls" that
   are not made of wall or rock.

 * Hezrou now have a passive attack that gives off a foul stench
   (implemented as stinking cloud).

 * "melon" is now the default name for custom fruit.

 * The number of different kinds of polearms has been reduced.
   Also, stiletto is no longer a distinct object from knife.

 * The "stone giant" has been renamed to just "giant", meaning
   its corpse can now be used for things like giant mummies,
   eliminating the need for the otherwise-unused generic "giant"
   monster.  This reduces the number of monsters in monst.c by
   one, with probably no gameplay effect at all.

 * Cavemen have had their race and alignment options adjusted.

 * The Caveman quest artifact is now Big Stick, an artifact club.
   Big Stick good.  Hit things with it.  Bam.  Bam bam.  If I did
   the coding correctly, it grants stealth when carried and magic
   resistance when wielded.  The bonus is +5 to-hit, +1d12 damage.

 * Mastodons have been replaced with mammoths.


Changes in 4.3.0.1:
-------------------

 * The game calls unseen monsters "something" rather than "it",
   since in many cases there is no (or a misleading) antecedent.

 * Sinks are usually placed next to walls.

 * Throwing gauntlets at a peaceful monster makes it hostile,
   allowing you to kill it without incurring the usual alignment
   penalty for angering or killing a generated-peaceful monster.

 * There are now four versions of Orcus Town.

 * There are now two versions of Asmodeus' Lair and two versions
   of Baalzebub's, but in any given game you only get one of them
   (i.e., you either get Asmo or Baal, not both).  However, you also
   get either Yeenoghu's Plaza or Dispater's Gauntlet, so the total
   number of demon lairs per game is the same as vanilla.

 * Random rooms, if large enough, can sometimes be non-rectangular.

 * The alignment record penalties for killing peaceful monsters have
   been rebalanced, and your maximum and minimum alignment record
   are always 100 and -100, respectively.

 * Changed the Caveman/Cavewoman rank titles.

 * Chaotics get alignment points for killing (hostile members of)
   their own race.

 * Neutrals can get alignment points for successful prayer (when not
   in trouble) even if their alignment record is already positive.

 * Lawfuls now reliably get an alignment point each time they help
   someone out of a trap (previously, you had a random chance of
   getting the point, depending on luck).

 * Slings have been buffed.  They now get a damage bonus (albeit, a
   reduced one compared to melee).  Cavemen get a multishot bonus for
   using a sling.  Flint and hard gems are less likely to break.
   Dual-wielding two slings lets you fire (on average) twice as many
   projectiles, provided your stack of projectiles is large enough;
   this uses your sling skill, not two-weapon skill (although you do
   still have to be capable of two-weapon combat to do it).

 * The range for projectiles fired from a launcher has been increased,
   especially for crossbow bolts.

 * Shamelessly copied the multiple-bones-pools implementation from
   NAO, then enhanced it to keep separate pools for each game mode
   (normal, explore, wizmode, setseed, polyinit).  I'd like to see
   this eventually go in upstream (but not until the next save break,
   because bones files from before the change won't load after).

 * Some monsters have been given more interesting attacks.  Notably,
   pit fiends now have an attack that creates pits.

 * Fixing status ailments with a unicorn horn is now mostly free; the
   only penalty is that a blessed horn can become uncursed.  Blessed
   horns are now guaranteed to fix at least one trouble (assuming you
   have any they can fix).  However, restoring lost attributes with a
   unicorn horn now always degrades its enchantment.

 * When you lose alignment points, you now get warning messages
   about it.  You also get messages when you regain alignment.

 * Engraving Elbereth no longer exercises wisdom.

 * Engravings are no longer degraded by walking, and the probability
   that random actions or inactions (including resting, searching)
   will erode an engraving is greatly reduced.  However, engraving
   additional text degrades what is already there.

 * Lizards (specifically), acid blobs, F, P, and T are guaranteed to
   drop corpses for the first hundred kills per monster type.

 * The effect of weapon skill on chance to hit has been magnified,
   and being restricted is now worse than being unskilled.

 * Bugfix: the monstr value for floating eyes was being calculated
   incorrectly, due to the way they are implemented.  This was
   causing them to generate too often too early.

 * Added a digit to the version number, so I can do more than one
   release based on a given version of upstream, without getting my
   version numbers horribly out of sync.

 * The chance for thrown projectiles to break now depends primarily on
   your skill.  Enchanted objects get an extra chance to survive (and
   negatively enchanted ones get an extra chance to break).

 * You can now #untrap falling rock traps, obtaining rocks.
   Also, disarming a projectile trap (rocks, arrows, or darts)
   now produces a few more projectiles than previously.

 * Players who wish to use spears should be able to find more
   of them now, introduced via the monster inventory mechanism.

 * Quasits have been buffed slightly, because they're boring, but
   I don't want to just remove them if they can be made interesting.

 * Manes are now in the W mlet, with wraiths and ghosts and other
   spirits of the dead.  This fits their flavour much better than
   their previous mlet assignment and also reduces color conflicts.

 * Rings that are dropped down a sink end up buried in the ground
   under the sink.  They can be reclaimed by destroying the sink,
   drying up the resulting fountain, and digging up the rings,
   which will now be identified.

 * The backstab bonus now scales with your skill in whatever weapon
   you are using.  Currently, the bonus potentially goes as high as 28
   per hit if you are expert but falls off significantly at lower
   skill levels.  This change probably gives rogues a very powerful
   mid-game, without making them overpowered in the late game; but
   it will need play testing for balance.

 * Added single-use wish sources at the top of Vlad's tower
   and in Orcus Town.  (Update: and one in the Wizard's Tower.)

 * The Wizard of Yendor gets more starting inventory now.  Some
   of it might actually be useful at that stage of the game.

 * Cherry-picked the "monsters get better equipment in Gehennom"
   feature from the Gehennom Fun Patch.  Also, arrow traps in
   Gehennom may yield silver arrows.

 * Now that Sokoban is somewhat easier for the haters to bypass or
   deal with in some other way without properly solving it, we're
   free to add a few new Sokoban levels:
   + Add four new versions of Soko-1: "Boomerang Boulders", "Through
     the Cracks", "Easy Peasey", and "First Things First".  The two
     existing vanilla versions are retained also, for a total of six.
   + Add three new versions of Soko-2, for a total of four.
     The added versions are "Fly on the Wall", "Boulder Halls
     of Zim", and "Two-Phase".  One of the existing vanilla
     versions is also retained.  The infamous "Sokoban 2 B"
     (steelypips) aka "soko2a" (nethackwiki) is excluded.
   + Add two new versions of Soko-3, for a total of four.
     The new ones are "Bring 'em on Down" and "Slot Machine".
   + Add one new version of Soko-4, "'Ring 'em Around", with
     the prize being a ring of polymorph control.
   I have some reservations about a couple of these, but it's hard
   for me to be objective about them, since I created them.  I've
   included them for now, pending user feedback.

 * The Oracle can now sell you enlightenment, in addition to the
   other services.  Also, the prices are calculated differently,
   in a way that should make them lower in the early game.

 * Monkeys are better at stealing things and getting away.

 * Additional rocks are sometimes generated on the floor of rooms.
   This is mainly a balance change, to prevent sling users from
   trivially running out of ammo -- sling has to have _some_ kind
   of advantage, as it's worse than other ranged weapons in most
   ways.  However, it also makes flavor sense, IMO, to have a lot
   of rocks laying around.

 * Wands of wishing are no longer rechargeable.

 * Role rebalance, round one.
   + Starting inventory has been adjusted for some roles: a bit more
     ammo or an additional spell book; low-percentage-chance items are
     either guranteed or removed, or you get a consolation prize if
     you don't get them; healers get eucalyptus; some roles get small
     enchantment adjustments on starting equipment.
   + Several role/race and role/alignment combinations are permitted
     that previously were not, and in one case vice versa.
   + The Barbarian role has had its melee skill options and quest
     artifact buffed.  (The Heart can now be invoked for a
     remove-curse effect; Barbarians get the blessed remove curse
     effect; other roles get the uncursed effect.)
   + Valkyries, Knights, and Samurai have had their melee prowess
     reduced a bit (so that their melee options are worse than
     Barbarians) but are compensated in other ways.
     - Valkyries now start with different inventory and can find a
       spellbook of cone of cold on quest home.  Their casting
       abilities still need to be balanced so they can use attack
       spells without becomming general-purpose casters.  I may need
       to give them starting skill in attack, we'll see.  Also,
       Valkyries fly now.
     - Knights can now get expert in crossbow, can find spare lances
       and a spare saddle on quest home, will not fall off and die
       when mounting their pony on turn 1, and will not break their
       lance while jousting if at least devoutly aligned.  Figuring
       out how to get to devout as early as possible under the Fourk
       alignment record formula is left as an exercise.
     - Samurai are guaranteed a longsword and some replacement ya and
       a saddle on the quest, and the Tsurugi now provides extrinsic
       speed when wielded.

 * Pulled in about fifty fixes for various vanilla bugs from an
   upstream "4.3 maintenance" branch.  The upstream master branch
   hasn't merged these changes yet for reasons involving release
   timing, but Fourk is at a different place in its dev cycle that
   makes them appropriate now.

 * The luck penalty in Sokoban can now be avoided by carrying a
   non-cursed luckstone or by hallucinating.  Also, the Sokoban luck
   penalty will never take your luck below -3.

 * The Statue of Perseus is now guaranteed to contain the shield of
   reflection and the sack (and the scimitar, just because).  This is
   mainly intended as a sop for players who insist on skipping
   Sokoban.  At least you don't have to do the Castle with no
   reflection and no container.

 * The differences between the different versions of Minetown have
   been enhanced.  Previously, several of them felt almost the same
   as one another.  Hopefully that is not the case now.

 * Barring bones, the only variant of Minetown that might not have a
   general store now is College Town, which has a guaranteed book
   shop, so you can at least easily price check scrolls (and books).

 * The Mimic of the Mines level has been made more interesting,
   bringing it somewhat closer to the other Mine's End levels in terms
   of both difficulty and loot.

 * Certain normally rare items are supplied in small numbers early in
   the game as floor items.  Specifically, filler levels at depth 2-6
   in the main dungeon each have an 80% chance to get one of these
   items, which is most often a scroll of scare monster but can also
   be wolfsbane, eucalytus, or a wand of enlightenment.

 * The ever controversial and rather boring Acehack/NetHack4 floating
   eye behavior (wherein you can't melee them at all) has been
   replaced with a new behavior that will probably be equally
   controversial but hopefully more interesting:  whatever hp damage
   you do to the floating eye you also sustain yourself, amplified
   proprortionally to your own experience level.  The exact formula
   may need to be tweaked, pending play testing.  The formula for
   monster-vs-monster is different from the formula for
   player-vs-monster, not because I think it should be, but because
   rebalancing player hitpoints vs monster hitpoints is a larger
   change that I didn't want to rush into yet.

 * Insteadeath by poison when you could have survived the damage
   will now only drain a level rather than killing you outright,
   if you are at least XL3.  Furthermore, starting characters have
   a 500-turn grace period to reach XL3 to protect against this.
   (You can still die by falling onto poisoned spikes or being hit by
   a poisoned weapon or whatever, if you do not have enough current HP
   to survive the damage that it does, or if you are running around
   at XL1 or XL2 past turn 500.)

 * The supply of rocks (embedded within the rock) has been increased,
   because slings are bad enough, compared to other launchers, without
   having to constantly worry about running out of rocks (which aren't
   even supposed to be the primary ammo; they're what you use when
   you're trying to conserve or have run out of flint and glass).

 * The Wizard of Yendor now has an attack that can change your
   alignment (law/neu/cha), but this effect is blocked if you are
   pious.  The main upshot of this is that early (pre-quest) alignment
   conversion no longer makes the game unwinnable, although it is
   still a significant inconvenience, since you will need to fight the
   Wizard before doing the quest, which is not the usual strategy.

 * The shopkeeper names list for general stores has been expanded,
   since that is the most common type of shop.  Also, some tool shop
   owners have been re-inserted into the list that were in (at least
   some ports of) 3.4.3 but had been removed at some point due to the
   #ifdef purge and/or platforms being dropped.  (This re-insert was
   not comprehensive.)

 * Arrows (against small monsters) and darts have been slightly
   buffed: one additional point of base damage.

 * Cherry-picked two trap-related changes from the Gehennom Fun Patch.
   Falling rock traps are no longer generated on levels 1-3 in the
   main dungeon, and when a monster is changed by a polymorph trap,
   there is now a chance for the trap to be used up.  The probability
   of this drops off deeper into the dungeon.  To be able to use the
   same polymorph trap on pets indefinitely with no chance of it being
   used up, you must find one at dungeon level 35 or deeper.

 * Made rock piercers brown, lurkers above red.  Eventually
   these will all be in mlet t (S_TRAPPER).

 * Marked umber hulks as HI_ULINE (i.e., underlined).  This
   is a pre-emptive measure, done for the same reason that xorns
   are now red:  eventually both of these large, distinctive,
   deep-rock-dwelling creatures are going to be in the same
   monster class together, probably mlet X (S_XORN), and I don't
   want either of them looking exactly the same as the other
   one used to look, if it can be avoided.

 * Moved leprechauns into the S_IMP (lowercase i) mlet class.
   For detailed justification, see the changelog entry (834cebee),
   but in brief, they are mischevious but usually not outright
   dangerous spirit/faerie beings appearing with a physical body,
   playing pranks, meddling, occasionally making people's fortunes,
   and there is folklore associated with capturing them, all of
   which is also true of imps and tengu.  Additionally, they are
   diminutive in stature like imps and quasits.  This reduces the
   number of in-use map characters by one, which is a Good Thing.
   To distinguish, leprechauns are bright green and homonculi are
   now gray (previously, both were green).

 * Differentiated nymphs.  Wood nymphs are the lowest-level and
   slightly easier to deal with than before (notably, they are now
   slightly slower than the player); water nymphs are a little
   tougher, and mountain nymphs are now the highest-level and most
   difficult nymphs.  They do NOT grow up into each other.  However,
   water nymphs (barring fountain schenanighans, which are always a
   player's fault) and especially mountain nymphs should now start
   showing up a little later in the game than before; wood nymphs
   should start showing up around the same time as before.

 * Changed the colors of two monsters (xorns to red, acid blobs to
   yellow, matching yellow dragons).  This is a pre-emptive measure
   to reduce color conflicts later, when certain monster classes
   eventually get combined.  Might as well let users go ahead and
   get used to the new colors for these monsters now.

 * Unicorn horns are now a technically finite resource (unless you can
   cast cancellation).  Cursed unicorn horns and the "Nothing happens"
   case are unchanged.

 * The formula for the player's odds of hitting monsters has been
   adjusted significantly.  Luck and experience level are now only
   added in on a logarithmic scale (together), meaning that always
   hitting everything no matter what is (hopefully) no longer a
   foregone conclusion in the late game.  It is to be expected that
   further tweaks to this formula will be required.

 * Disabled the "network MOTD" feature, since it requires a public
   server, which Fourk currently does not have.

 * Alignment record points are no longer granted for killing most
   kinds of monsters.

 * Gaining alignment record points through sacrifice is now somewhat
   more difficult (especially for non-chaotics); although certain
   kinds of special-cased corpses are still particularly effective.

 * Alignment record now starts at 10 for lawfuls, 15 for neutrals,
   20 for chaotics.  (These numbers may get adjusted later, not sure;
   as it stands, it means chaotics don't have to improve their record
   at all to go on the quest; lawfuls must improve it by 10.)  For
   now, the role-specific differences in starting alignment have been
   evened out; this may change later, as part of role differentiation,
   but I want to get the basic balance figured out first.

 * The chance for an engraving to be successfully written exactly as
   intended, rather than in a pre-eroded form, now starts higher than
   in 3.4.3 but falls off if you write Elbereth too many times.  The
   number of times you can write Elbereth and still keep a good chance
   of writing things successfully is proportional to experience level
   and is also somewhat better for forms of engraving that use up
   resources.  Players who use Elbereth sparingly in emergencies are
   likely to notice a positive effect on its reliability (if they know
   enough not to smudge it after writing it, write one at a time,
   etc.); players who abuse Elbereth extensively will definitely
   notice that it is less reliable now.  Failure is accompanied by
   messages about your body_part(HAND) cramping up.

 * To compensate for the reduced death drops as you kill many monsters
   of the same kind (which happens in normal play for some monsters,
   particularly common ones generated in groups), the base death drop
   probability has been adjusted upward.  Thus, the first few monsters
   you kill of any given type are now more likely to leave death drops
   than before.  This needs play testing for balance, but the
   intention is that the overall number of death drops in a typical
   normal (non-farming) game should be about the same.

 * Any given type of monster becomes less likely to drop corpses and
   death drops as you kill more and more of them.  Somewhere around 80
   kills you stop getting death drops from that type of monster, and
   somewhere around 225 kills, you stop getting corpses for that kind
   of monster.  This is expected to be most noticeable with puddings
   but may also be relevant for extinctionists and throne farmers.
   I'd have made it top out at a thousand or so kills, but the kill
   count only goes up to 255, probably so it can fit in a single byte.
   In any case, this is unlikely to be noticed in normal play except
   with large creatures such as dragons, which are no longer
   guaranteed to drop corpses every single time.

 * Updated branding, docs, build rules, and such to refer to nhfourk
   (for filenames) and NetHack Fourk (for human-readable names) where
   appropriate.  References to NetHack 4 and nethack4 have also been
   retained in many places, since that is the upstream codebase on
   which NetHack Fourk is based.
